	// APIPath is used by generate and configure commands.
	//
	// API Path is specified with the -api-path flag.

	// commands.
	//
	// APIRoot is specified with the -api-root flag.

	// can be merged. It is only used by the merge-release-pr command, and the
	// value is expected to be taken from the environment variable recorded in
	// env-vars.txt by the create-release-pr command. The value is the HEAD commit at
	// the start of the create-release-pr command, and it is used by merge-release-pr
	// to determine whether any source files for a library have been modified in
	// GitHub since the release PR was initiated (thereby invalidating the release of
	// that library).
	//
	// BaselineCommit is specified with the -baseline-commit flag.

	// DockerHostRootDir specifies the host view of a mount point that is
	// mounted as DockerMountRootDir from the Librarian view, when Librarian
	// is running in Docker. For example, if Librarian has been run via a command
	// such as "docker run -v /home/user/librarian:/app" then DockerHostRootDir
	// would be "/home/user/librarian" and DockerMountRootDir would be "/app".
	//
	// This information is required to enable Docker-in-Docker scenarios. When
	// creating a Docker container for language-specific operations, the methods
	// accepting directory names are all expected to be from the perspective of
	// the Librarian code - but the mount point specified when running Docker
	// from within Librarian needs to be specified from the host perspective,
	// as the new Docker container is created as a sibling of the one running
	// Librarian.
	//
	// For example, if we're in the scenario above, with
	// DockerHostRootDir=/home/user/librarian and DockerMountRootDir=/app,
	// executing a command which tries to mount the /app/work/googleapis directory
	// as /apis in the container, the eventual Docker command would need to include
	// "-v /home/user/librarian/work/googleapis:/apis"
	//
	// DockerHostRootDir and DockerMountDir are currently populated from
	// KOKORO_HOST_ROOT_DIR and KOKORO_ROOT_DIR environment variables respectively.
	// These are automatically supplied by Kokoro. Other Docker-in-Docker scenarios
	// are not currently supported, but could be implemented by populating these
	// configuration values in a similar way.
	DockerHostRootDir string

	// DockerMountRootDir specifies the Librarian view of a mount point that is
	// mounted as DockerHostRootDir from the host view, when Librarian is running in
	// Docker. See the documentation for DockerHostRootDir for more information.
	DockerMountRootDir string

	// EnvFile is the path to the file used to store environment variables, to
	// propagate information from one step to another in a CI flow. The file
	// is a list of key=value lines, where the key becomes an environment variable
	// in the next step of the CI flow. Every key must start with an underscore.
	//
	// EnvFile is only used in the create-release-pr and merge-release-pr commands.
	// It is always optional; if it is unspecified, it defaults to env-file.txt
	// within WorkRoot.
	//
	// EnvFile is specified with the -env-file flag.
	EnvFile string

	// GitHubToken is the access token to use for all operations involving
	// GitHub.
	//
	// GitHubToken is used by the create-release-pr, configure, update-apis
	// and update-image-tag commands, when Push is true. It is always used by
	// the merge-release-pr and publish-release-artifacts commands.
	//
	// GitHubToken is not specified by a flag, as flags are logged and the
	// access token is sensitive information. Instead, it is fetched from the
	// LIBRARIAN_GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.
	GitHubToken string

	// GitUserEmail is the email address used in Git commits. It is used in
	// all commands that create commits in a language repository:
	// create-release-pr, configure, update-apis and update-image-tag.
	//
	// GitUserEmail is optional, with a default value of noreply-cloudsdk@google.com
	// being used for commits if it's unspecified.
	//
	// GitUserEmail is specified with the -git-user-email flag.
	GitUserEmail string

	// GitUserName is the display name used in Git commits. It is used in
	// all commands that create commits in a language repository:
	// create-release-pr, configure, update-apis and update-image-tag.
	//
	// GitUserName is optional, with a default value of "Google Cloud SDK"
	// being used for commits if it's unspecified.
	//
	// GitUserName is specified with the -git-user-name flag.
	GitUserName string

	// Image is the language-specific container image to use for language-specific
	// operations. It is primarily used for testing Librarian and/or new images.
	//
	// Image is used by all commands which perform language-specific operations.
	// (This covers all commands other than merge-release-pr.) If this is set via
	// the -image flag, it is expected to be used directly (potentially including a repository
	// and/or tag). If the -image flag is not set, the full image specification to
	// use is derived from the pieces of information:
	//
	// - Name: As specified in language repository configuration, or
	// a default of "google-cloud-{Language}-generator"
	// - Tag: As specified in the language repository state file, where available
	// - Repository: The LIBRARIAN_REPOSITORY environment variable, if set.
	//
	// Image is specified with the -image flag.
	Image string

	// Language is the language of the libraries being maintained by the current command.
	// This affects the default language repository to clone unless otherwise specified,
	// the default image for language-specific operations, and the section of API service
	// configurations to check for requested libraries within the configure command. This
	// is not validated to any particular set of values, but the expected values which would
	// work with the configure command and clone appropriate repositories without additional
	// effort are "cpp", "dotnet", "go", "java", "node", "php", "python", and "ruby".
	// The values are case-sensitive.
	//
	// Language is required for all commands except merge-release-pr.
	//
	// Language is specified with the -language flag.
	Language string

	// TODO(https://github.com/googleapis/librarian/issues/265): refer to architecture
	// documentation about language identifiers when the doc has been written.

	// LibraryID is the identifier of a specific library to release or update, for the
	// create-release-pr and update-apis commands respectively. In both cases it is optional;
	// when omitted, all libraries which are configured within the repository's Librarian
	// state file will be considered for update/release.
	//
	// When LibraryID is specified for create-release-pr, a release is created even if there
	// are no commits for the library which would normally trigger a release.
	//
	// LibraryID is specified with the -library-id flag.
	LibraryID string

	// LibraryVersion is the version string used when creating a release for a specific library,
	// overriding whatever new version would otherwise be suggested. It is only used in the
	// create-release-pr command, where it is optional and can only be specified when LibraryID
	// is also specified.
	//
	// Use cases for specifying LibraryVersion include:
	// - Releasing a library for the first time
	// - Promoting a library to GA
	// - Creating a major version bump
	//
	// LibraryVersion is specified with the -library-version flag.
	LibraryVersion string

	// Push determines whether to push changes to GitHub. It is used in
	// all commands that create commits in a language repository:
	// create-release-pr, configure, update-apis and update-image-tag.
	// These commands all create pull requests if they
	//
	// By default (when Push isn't explicitly specified), commits are created in
	// the language repo (whether a fresh clone or one specified with RepoRoot)
	// but no pull request is created. In this situation, the description of the
	// pull request that would have been created is displayed in the output of
	// the command.
	//
	// When Push is true, GitHubToken must also be specified.
	//
	// Push is specified with the -push flag. No value is required.
	Push bool

	// ReleaseID is the identifier of a release PR. Each release PR created by
	// Librarian has a release ID, which is included in both the PR description and
	// the commit message of every commit within the release PR. This is effectively
	// used for internal bookkeeping, to collate all library releases within a single
	// release flow. The format of ReleaseID is effectively opaque; it is currently
	// timestamp-based but could change to a UUID or similar in the future. It is
	// generated by the create-release-pr command and automatically propagated to other
	// steps within the release flow.
	//
	// ReleaseID is required for the merge-release-pr and create-release-artifacts commands,
	// and is only used by those commands.
	//
	// ReleaseID is specified with the -release-id flag.
	ReleaseID string

	// ReleasePRURL is the URL of the release PR to merge once all requirements
	// have been satisfied. It is only used by merge-release-pr, where it is required.
	// The format is the regular GitHub PR URL:
	// https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/pull/14910
	//
	// ReleasePRURL is specified with the -release-pr-url flag.
	ReleasePRURL string

	// RepoRoot is the local root directory of the language repository, which can
	// be specified relative to the current working directory. The repository must
	// be in a clean state (i.e. git status should report no changes) to avoid mixing
	// Librarian-created changes with other changes.
	//
	// RepoRoot is used by all commands which operate on a language repository:
	// configure, create-release-artifacts, create-release-pr, generate, update-apis,
	// update-image-tag.
	//
	// RepoRoot is always optional, and always mutually exclusive with RepoURL, as both
	// are used to explicitly indicate a language repository to use.
	//
	// When specified for the generate command, the repo is checked to determine whether the
	// specified API path is configured as a library. See the generate command documentation
	// for more details. For all other commands, omitting both RepoRoot and RepoUrl is equivalent
	// to specifying a RepoUrl of https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-{Language}.
	//
	// RepoRoot is specified with the -repo-root flag.
	RepoRoot string

	// RepoURL is the URL to clone the language repository from. It is a mutually exclusive
	// alternative to RepoRoot; see the RepoRoot documentation for more details.
	//
	// RepoURL is specified with the -repo-url flag.
	RepoURL string

	// SyncAuthToken provides an auth token used when polling a synchronization
	// URL at the end of the merge-release-pr command, if SyncURLPrefix has been
	// specified.
	//
	// SyncAuthToken is not specified by a flag, as flags are logged and the
	// access token is sensitive information. Instead, it is fetched from the
	// LIBRARIAN_SYNC_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.
	SyncAuthToken string

	// SyncURLPrefix is the prefix used to build commit synchronization URLs.
	// It is only used by merge-release-pr, and is optional. When specified, a
	// full URL is constructed by appending the commit hash of the merged pull
	// request to the specified prefix, and polling until that URL can be fetched
	// via a GET request which includes the SyncAuthToken. SyncAuthToken must
	// be specified if SyncURLPrefix is specified.
	//
	// SyncURLPrefix is specified with the -sync-url-prefix flag.
	SyncURLPrefix string

	// SecretsProject is the Google Cloud project containing Secret Manager secrets
	// to provide to the language-specific container commands via environment variables.
	//
	// SecretsProject is used by all commands which perform language-specific operations.
	// (This covers all commands other than merge-release-pr.) If no value is set, any
	// language-specific operations which include an environment variable based on a secret
	// will act as if the secret name wasn't set (so will just use a host environment variable
	// or default value, if any).
	//
	// SecretsProject is specified with the -secrets-project flag.
	SecretsProject string

	// SkipIntegrationTests is used by the create-release-pr and create-release-artifacts
	// commands, and disables integration tests if it is set to a non-empty value.
	// The value must reference a bug (e.g., b/12345).
	//
	// SkipIntegrationTests is specified with the -skip-integration-tests flag.
	SkipIntegrationTests string

	// Tag is the new tag for the language-specific Docker image, used only by the
	// update-image-tag command. All operations within update-image-tag are performed
	// using the new tag.
	//
	// Tag is specified with the -tag flag.
	Tag string

	// TagRepoURL is the GitHub repository to push the tag and create a release
	// in. This is only used in the publish-release-artifacts command:
	// when all artifacts have been published to package managers,
	// documentation sites etc., tags/releases are created on GitHub, and
	// TagRepoURL identifies this repository.
	//
	// TagRepoURL is specified with the -tag-repo-url flag.
	TagRepoURL string

	// WorkRoot is the root directory used for temporary working files, including
	// any repositories that are cloned. By default, this is created in /tmp with
	// a timestamped directory name (e.g. /tmp/librarian-20250617T083548Z) but
	// can be specified with the -work-root flag.
	//
	// WorkRoot is used by all librarian commands.
