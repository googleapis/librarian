# This Cloud Build configuration is used by a Louhi flow for the Artifact
# Registry (AR) Exit Gate process (go/cloud-sdk-ar-exit-gate-onboarding).
#
# This build step creates the librarian container image and publishes it to the
# 'images-dev' repository, which serves as the entry point for the AR Exit Gate.
# After passing the gate's security checks, the image is promoted and
# published to the 'images-prod' repository.
