# How to Contribute

This repository is intended to support Google Cloud SDK in
generating and releasing client libraries for Google Cloud APIs.

We do not expect this repository to be particularly relevant to
developers outside Google, and we don't expect or seek external code
contributions. That doesn't mean it will never happen, but it would
be unusual.

If you want to request a change within this repository and you're
not a member of the Google Cloud SDK team, please create an
[issue](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet/issues)
for discussion first, clearly explaining your intended use. We will
close pull requests from external contributors which aren't the
result of a suitable discussion.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require
review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. If you have a
specific team member in mind, please request their review directly,
otherwise just leave the default group reviewer.

## Issues

When creating an issue, feel free to assign it to an individual if
there is a natural owner. Otherwise, leave it unassigned for a
triage rotation to pick up.
